PART 1: Circle.py

In this program, the turtle moves along a circular path with a constant angular speed of 5 rad/s and a linear velocity of 3 unit/s.
A function is created plotCircle to plot the trajectory of the turtle.
To run Circle.py run the Launcher file cleaner_py.launch.


PART 2: Square_closedloop.py

In this program, the turtle is expected to traverse the path of a square with a angular speed of 0.2 rad/s and linear velocity of 2 units/s.
The angular velocity is used to change the orientation of the turtle bot. A function move is written to traverse the bot in the linear direction.
The rotate function is to rotate the turtle in the direction of motion.
To run Square_closedloop.py run the Launcher file Launcher_closedloop.launch.


PART 3: Sqaure_openloop.py

In this program, the turtle is expected to traverse the path of a square with a angular speed of 0.2 rad/s and linear velocity of 2 units/s.
The angular velocity is used to change the orientation of the turtle bot. A function move is written to traverse the bot in the linear direction.
The rotate function is to rotate the turtle in the direction of motion.
To run Sqaure_openloop.py run the Launcher file Launcher_openloop.launch.
