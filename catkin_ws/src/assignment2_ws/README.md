# Assignment 2

## PART 1: Circle.py

In this program, the turtle moves along a circular path with a constant angular speed of 5 rad/s and a linear velocity of 3 unit/s.
A function is created plotCircle to plot the trajectory of the turtle.
To run `Circle.py` the following launch file `circle_py.launch` has to be run by executing the command, `python circle_py.launch`.

## PART 2: Square_closedloop.py

In this program, the turtle is expected to traverse the path of a square with a angular speed of 0.2 rad/s and linear velocity of 2 units/s.
The angular velocity is used to change the orientation of the turtle bot. A function move is written to traverse the bot in the linear direction.
The rotate function is to rotate the turtle in the direction of motion.
To run `Square_closedloop.py` the following launch file `Launcher_closedloop.launch` has to be run by executing the command, `python Launcher_closedloop.launch`.

## PART 3: Square_openloop.py

In this program, the turtle is expected to traverse the path of a square with a angular speed of 0.2 rad/s and linear velocity of 2 units/s.
The angular velocity is used to change the orientation of the turtle bot. A function move is written to traverse the bot in the linear direction.
The rotate function is to rotate the turtle in the direction of motion.
To run `Square_openloop.py` the following launch file `Launcher_openloop.launch` has to be run by executing the command, `python Launcher_openloop.launch`.
